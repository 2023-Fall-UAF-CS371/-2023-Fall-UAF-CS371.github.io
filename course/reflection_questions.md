# Reflection questions

## Unit 1

1. What does it mean to say something is ethical? Give an example of a normative ethical assessment that you agree with and one that you do not. Give an example of a descriptive ethical statement. 

2. Pick a piece of technology that you use every day. Make a list of the goals or values that you think the system is designed to achieve. For example: Does it connect people? Does it make something easier? Does it make something harder? Does it make something less expensive? Or does it make something impossible? What are the benefits? What are some of the potential drawbacks if the particular piece of technology achieves its goal? 

3. Consider some ethical dilemmas that arise due to limited resources. Give an example of a resource that has become less limited due to advances in technology or computing, and give an example of a resource that has become more limited.


## Unit 2

1. What are the three ways in which people commonly misunderstand deontology? What are the shortcomings with each of these misunderstandings? 

2. Consider an ethical quandary in your own life, or something you’ve read about recently in the news, which you can describe in terms of competing duties. What aspects of the situation could help you determine which duties are the most fundamental? What aspects of the situation could help you determine which duties are most relevant?

3. Recall our example in section 2.5 about deciding who should get a scholarship. Reflect on a time that you were either a part of or subject to a decision that required trading off various goods and measures. What were the measures? What was included and what wasn’t? Were all these measures meaningful or comparable? 

4. One of the central challenges for utilitarian thinkers is breadth: including everyone who should be part of the “who,” including all of the relevant kinds of good (and harm) in the “what,” and thinking of the long-term consequences as well as the near-term ones. 

    a. Why do you think this is difficult? Give a specific scenario where changing the “who” can lead to a vastly different calculus for outcomes. 
    
    b. Are there any ways for utilitarians to get better at including everything and everyone that should be part of their calculations? 

5. Think of a situation — professional, personal, or societal — that could have been better handled by those involved if they had given more weight to long-term consequences, as opposed to short-term ones. Why, specifically, do you think the long-term consequences were ignored or undervalued? What, realistically, could have helped the decision makers to consider or understand the long-term effects of their choices? 

6. Think of a habit you have tried to adopt (or tried to break). What about it was easy, and why? What about it was difficult, and why? What personal qualities helped you succeed in (or prevented you from) altering your habit? 

7. How do goals differ from virtues? Can you list some of your goals, and the virtues that could support you in working toward those goals? 

8. Think of someone you admire. What virtues do you think they strive for, and why? Do you think that they are usually successful in their attempts to live according to those virtues? How do they handle their failures to live up to their (apparently) chosen virtues? 

9. The term “digital divide” is used in this book and in the media to call attention to the fact that not everyone has access to reliable and modern information and communication technologies including computers, smartphones, and even the internet. Analyze how one or more of the following aspects of modern society that you take for granted can happen via these technologies: registering for classes, paying your friends for dinner, applying for a job, or figuring out how to get from your home to a new location. How would being on the other side of the digital divide change what you are able to do? What would be easier? What would be harder?

10. Think of a community that has been important for your personal development. What values do you hold, or patterns of behavior do you have, that were instilled in you by that community? How did they come to be part of your own identity? 

11. What goals of self-realization do you have for yourself? What are the community contexts in which those goals are meaningful? 

12. Compare two traditions encompassed in a single framework. What are the similarities? What are the differences? 

13. What is a contemporary issue in technology that is not well addressed by the four major frameworks discussed in the chapter? How could one or more of the three contemporary responses help us describe and address that issue?


## Unit 3

1. Pick a decision-making process that incorporates technology, data, information, and knowledge in modern society, such as college admissions, targeted advertising, or bail and sentencing. Describe what needs to be collected or processed, such as what data, processed how, incorporating what background knowledge or judgments, at each stage of the DIKW paradigm to arrive at these decisions. What risks are involved with formalizing such a system in this way? How could errors at one level of the hierarchy impact the functioning at other levels? 

2. Find an example of a data storage methodology that predates computing. What were the goals of this methodology? What had to be left out because it could not be recorded in this way? Find an example of a modern, digital age, technology that addresses this shortcoming. How have we, as a society, come to use this new technology? Has it helped or hurt our decision-making abilities? 

3. When you are preparing to make even a small purchase decision — for example, what to eat for lunch — what data goes into your decision making? Do you consider price nutrition, where it comes from, aesthetic qualities, reviews from friends, reviews from the internet, or other sources? Make a list of all the sources of data and/or information that you could consult when making this decision. Do you always use all these when making a decision? Why or why not? 

4. Dive deeper into one of the situations in which bias encoded in an algorithm has had impacts in our society — predictive policing; weblining and the digital divide; targeted advertising; bail and sentencing software; or hiring and admissions — and find a recent example in popular media. Take this article and analyze it through one of the ethical frameworks we discussed in chapter 2. For example, if we are looking at hiring software through a utilitarian lens, what is the objective of using the software? What values, such as time or money, are being traded off? Or if we look at sentencing software through a virtue ethics lens, what are the virtues, such as fairness and generosity, that the system design strives to emulate? 

5. Think about attempting to verify something as complex as a medical research paper (e.g., more chocolate makes you less likely to have a heart attack) or a data-based claim in local media (e.g., crime is on the rise). Pick one of these and attempt to find the data necessary to verify the claim. Were you able to? Given the data that you have access to, are you able to verify the claims given the knowledge and information-processing abilities that you currently possess? Why or why not? 

6. Consider the discussion in section 3.6.3 about the idea that social media and mass platforming will bring together communities and usher in a “bond of perpetual friendship between the kindred nations.” In what ways have things gotten easier or better through the use of mass platforms such as YouTube, Facebook, TikTok, and other social media? In what ways has this changed how we communicate with each other and where we get our information? How has this changed how we come to know things? 

7. In this chapter we have claimed that knowledge is a shared enterprise between ourselves and society. Justify this claim by breaking down the ways in which we decide that a particular piece of information is legitimate — for example, that a particular historical event really happened, that vaccines prevent illness, or another topic of your choice.




## Unit 4

1. When you ask yourself the question, “What is a person?” what do you typically mean? Describe the questions that you ask yourself in terms of metaphysical, epistemological, and axiological questions. Which of these questions do you consider most important? Which is the least? 

2. We have discussed that privacy can be conceived as a right or an interest. Which of these arguments do you find more persuasive and compelling, and why? Which do you think is more applicable in considering the role of technology in society? 

3. Suppose that someone uses demographic information associated with your online shopping or entertainment preferences to draw conclusions about how you will behave in the future. When data about you is used in this way, what is at stake in terms of how others might perceive you? What is at stake in how you perceive yourself? 

4. In the following situations, consider how one might use the conceptual resources of this chapter, including notions of privacy and personhood, to articulate why these situations constitute invasions of privacy, or why they are acceptable. 

    a. Doxxing a public figure. 
    
    b. Publishing voting records at the aggregate level for a county, or at an individual level. 
    
    c. An insurance company requiring you to install a tracking app on your car in order to be insured. 
    
5. The time gap between when we create data and when someone accesses it does seem to matter, but it is not clear how and why it matters. Think about someone posting old photos of you online even if they were always available. Would it feel different from someone posting a photo from last week? Why or why not? What ideas from your understanding of personhood help you explain this?

6. Data about individuals is collected in the United States well before the individual is born, as electronic medical records of their time in utero, not to mention media posts and writings by parents and other connected individuals. This data could be used, in the aggregate, for demographic or epidemiological modeling. Can you imagine reasons that a person would want to control or delete such data? Who do you think should have the right to choose what happens to the data? Shared data about a pregnancy can have ramifications for multiple people. Which individuals have a stake in the data? 

7. Choose a particular type of technology that has changed substantially over the years, such as social media. Justify privacy as a necessary condition for personhood, and defend this condition through iterations of the particular piece of technology that you have chosen.



## Unit 5

1. How do you perceive the nature of the relationship between technology and society? How has this perception changed (or not changed) after reading this chapter? 

2. Pick one of the spheres detailed in the chapter and formulate some additional problems that arise at the social level with respect to technological change and development. How do our perceptions and definitions of what technology is or can be change the questions we ask? Use at least two definitions of technology to answer this question. 

3. In section 5.4.3, “Strategies for Analysis,” we discussed the idea of technology development as social experiment. Although we hinted at several ways in which this view can go awry, we left concrete instances out. As a reflection, find an example of a new technology in which the experiment was not well thought through. Identify the inter- vention, subjects, and any problems that arose from this experiment. 

4. During times in the SARS-COVID-19 pandemic, many schools at both the K–12 and college levels went online. This was done abruptly in the spring of 2020 and left many students and families potentially disconnected due to the digital divide. Additionally, it required many families to take on support roles typically furnished by schools, including providing technical support, supervision of the learning process, and preparing lunches for students. Use the critical questions from section 5.4.3, including the ideas of pluralities, interconnections, and responses, to discuss this process both at the level of the individual family and the level of local decision makers (e.g., the government officials or school administration). What happens if we analyze the rise and development of massively open online courseware using the same questions? 

5. Recall our discussion about the history of photography and the biases that once encoded in a piece of technology can perpetuate into the future. Find an example of another technology that encodes particular biases or ways of thoughts. What are these? How do they continue to impact society today? Are there any of the tools from this chapter that would help address these issues during the technology development process? 

6. Consider some of the “societies” of which you are a part: a family, a school, a sports team, a state, religious congregation, or a country. How does your role in one or more of these societies change how you perceive a particular piece of technology? For example, as an individual you may not like the idea of having a biometric identification for your cell phone, but as a member of a state, you may think that the government should store biometric information on all its citizens. Use the tools from this chapter to take a piece of technology and analyze it from two or more societal views. 

7. Give original examples of common traps in thinking when participating in technology development including the formalism trap, the framing trap, the portability trap, the ripple effect trap, and the solutionism trap. Evaluate a technological system in light of these traps and identify issues arising from each.


## Unit 6

1. Define the characteristics that typically constitute a profession as well as the special responsibilities that come along with being a professional in technology development. Explain how these responsibilities differ from another profession, such as medicine or law, and what aspects are the same. 

2. Consider our deep dive into the ACM and the IEEE codes of ethics in section 6.3.1. Many of the qualities developed in these codes may overlap with your own personal ethics (e.g., honest and accurate assessment), but what happens if they do not? Do any of these stated goals differ from your personal ethics? When acting in a professional capacity how would you deal with this tension? 

3. Find a recent news article or other account about a controversial technology-related issue (e.g., issues around the deployment of a new system), fault in a piece of software or deployed technology that caused harm, or less than upstanding behavior by an individual or company in technology development space. Use a code of ethics, such as the ACM’s Code of Ethics, to argue both in favor and against the issue. 

    a. Using the same example, take one of the ethical frameworks from chapter 2 and use it to justify a different decision from the one you came to using the ACM Code of Ethics. 
    
    b. Again using the same example, give an example of institutional process (e.g., development practices, laws, or regulations) that would mitigate this issue in the future. Do you think such a policy should be implemented? At what level? Why or why not? 
    
4. Go to the National Society of Professional Engineers Board of Ethical Review (https:// www.nspe.org/resources/ethics/board-ethical-review) and find a case that addresses an issue you find interesting or contentious. Using the ethical frameworks developed in chapter 2 along with your own personal ethics, identify what was at stake in the case. What values were upheld? Which were compromised or violated?

5. Imagine that you are working in a professional setting and you become aware that an individual is doing something not in accordance with your personal code of ethics. What steps would you take? How do those steps change if the person is your boss, or someone on your project team, or someone on another team? How would these steps change if they were violating either a professional code of ethics, a company policy, or a law? 

6. Imagine instead that you become aware of a company policy that goes against your own personal code of ethics; how would the steps you take change? How would this change if instead the policy went against a professional code of ethics? 

7. Instead of an organization in which you are involved, imagine that some technology you use is violating a code of professional ethics, such as an app collecting data that it should not or a product that makes claims that are untrue. What steps would you take? How would this change if what the technology were doing was illegal?
